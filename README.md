Perl CGI tools for manipulating language.

Hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using a [PSGI/Plack buildpack](https://github.com/miyagawa/heroku-buildpack-perl), 
and shoved into PSGI using [CGI::Emulate::PSGI](http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/CGI-Emulate-PSGI-0.15/lib/CGI/Emulate/PSGI.pm),
allowing 10-year-old CGI code to run again, nearly unaltered.
